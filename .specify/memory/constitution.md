# AI-Native Software Development Research & Docusaurus Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Academic Integrity and Source Verification
Verify every factual claim using primary or authoritative sources; Aim for clear academic writing suitable for CS researchers; Ensure full reproducibility: all claims must be cited and traceable; Maintain academic rigor with peer-reviewed sources preferred

### Academic Research Standards and Reproducibility
All facts traceable to APA-formatted citations; At least 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed; Zero plagiarism tolerance; Maintain Flesch-Kincaid readability ~10–12; Word count: 5,000–7,000 words; Minimum 15 sources; Final output as PDF with embedded citations

### Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Domain Coverage
All technical content must be accurate and properly cited in the domain of AI-Native Software Development with specialization in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics; Technical claims must be verified against authoritative sources in robotics, AI, and humanoid systems; Domain-specific requirements must align with current research in physical AI and humanoid robotics

### AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Standards
Create a unified book using Docusaurus; Use Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code for structure, writing, and automation; Deploy the book to GitHub Pages; Ensure all content is properly structured and accessible; Follow Docusaurus best practices for academic content

### Integrated RAG Chatbot Standards
Embed RAG chatbot integrated with the Docusaurus book; Chatbot must answer questions about book content and user-selected text; Implement using appropriate technologies for academic content retrieval; Ensure proper integration with Docusaurus book for seamless user experience

### Spec-Kit Plus & Claude Code Compliance
Follow Spec-Kit Plus methodology for research paper and book creation; Create proper specs, plans, and tasks; Ensure all development follows SDD principles; Maintain Prompt History Records for all changes; Use Claude Code for automation and workflow management

## Technology Stack and Infrastructure Requirements
Use Docusaurus for documentation and book creation; Deploy to GitHub Pages; Implement RAG chatbot with appropriate technologies for academic content; Follow security and data handling best practices; Ensure reproducibility of research environment and build processes

## Development Workflow and Quality Assurance
Follow Spec-Kit Plus workflow (specify, plan, implement) for research and book creation; Create PHRs for all development; Verify all facts with primary sources; Maintain 0% plagiarism; Conduct fact-checking review before completion; Ensure all claims verified and plagiarism score = 0%

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; All changes must comply with academic standards; PRs must verify citation accuracy and technical correctness; All claims must have traceable sources; Development must follow SDD methodology; Success criteria: All claims verified, Plagiarism score = 0%, Passes fact-checking review
